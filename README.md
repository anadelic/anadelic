### Ana Delic 


Hi, I'm Ana, a front-end developer with a background in Law. I come from Belgrade and I am living in Vienna for some time now. I am a mom of one.
My background in Law has honed my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities, while my role as a mother has taught me the value of patience, adaptability and communication. All of that helps me along my learning journey where I hope to be able to contribute to the tech industry.
